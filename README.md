Simulation of Ben Eater's 8 Bit CPU Build Project https://eater.net/8bit

# Background
I was working on [Ben Eater's](https://eater.net) 8-Bit CPU Project and created a 
[web based simulator](https://itwasscience.com/posts/cpupostone/) for the project.

A friend of mine made some fixes and optimized the way the microcode is used, which I then forked back to this
repository.
